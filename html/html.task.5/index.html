			<p id="one">Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday,
				Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of
				Sanders.</p>
			<p> <br> </p>
    		<p id="two">(_"What does 'under the name' mean?" asked Christopher Robin._<br>

				"_It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived
				under it._"<br>
				
				_"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Christopher Robin._<br>
				
				_"Now I am," said a growly voice._<br>
				
				_"Then I will go on," said I._)</p>

					
			<p></p>
			<p id="three">One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle
				of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,
				and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.
				
				Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between
				his paws and began to think.
				
				First of all he said to himself: "That buzzing-noise means something.
				You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing,
				without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's
				making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise
				that _I_ know of is because you're a bee."
				
				Then he thought another long time, and said: "And the only reason for
				being a bee that I know of is making honey."
				
				And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making honey is
				so as _I_ can eat it." So he began to climb the tree.
				
				He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a
				little song to himself. It went like this:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p id="four"> Isn't it funny
				How a bear likes honey?
				Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
				I wonder why he does?</p>
